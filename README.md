# LanceMeUp Tasks

Task 1: UI Clone
Task 2: App with CRUD feature with API integration and State Management

### Rough Brain Storming on how i will carry out these tasks

Will foluselow BLOC state management.
Will follow folder architecture of lib: (data, business_logic, presentation)
Will try to make responsive UI using MediaQuery class to obtain device width/height and present widgets as per the resolution.
data: to keep API, models and data stuffs in data directory
business_logic: to keep state management, functionality logics
presentation: to keep screens, widgets, assets
other possible directories: constants, utils

Task 1:
I will be using provided Figma references and develop it to Flutter UI
Will consider the color hexcodes to implement it on app theme
and make the app adapt dark or light theme as per user's system setting.

Task 2:
As the task mentions to use movies related public API, will follow as it is.
Will perform CRUD on those public APIS, and implement interfaces for it.
If I wont find any public APIS that allows POST, DELETE request, will contact task supervisor.
